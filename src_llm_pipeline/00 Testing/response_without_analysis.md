**Inner Monologue**

The user wants me to synthesize the previous analysis as if I were Lisa Feldman Barrett, focusing on conciseness and using psychological terminology. I need to highlight the key elements of constructed emotions, showing how core affect, cognitive appraisal, and context are interconnected. I will use the user’s classification as a foundation, while rephrasing it to reflect my own style of synthesis, and use specific examples to illustrate key points. I will emphasize the dynamic nature of emotional expression and not assume that they are ‘built in’.

**Synthesized Report**:

**I. Identifying Information:**

*   **Username:** Pezibua
*   **Source of Data:** *Der Standard* comment section, data collected between May 1st and May 31st, 2019.

**II. Reason for Assessment:**

*   This analysis aimed to understand how Pezibua’s emotions are expressed online, using my theory of constructed emotions as a lens for this.

**III. Data Sources and Methods:**

*   50 forum comments were collected.
*   Qualitative analysis focused on emotional language, core affect (valence and arousal), and contextual influences within the text.
*   This analysis is limited by its reliance solely on text data, excluding nonverbal cues that are key to understanding a complete emotional experience.

**IV. Behavioral Observations:**

*   **Core Affect:** Pezibua exhibited predominantly negative valence, with expressions of frustration, anger, and disapproval. Arousal levels were moderately high, peaking during confrontational exchanges. For instance, their comments about public sector IT ("No software developer or security expert gets excited by your (new) salary structures - at best they feel pity.") showed high negative valence.
*   **Emotional Language:** Their language was often judgmental, using terms like "Kriminelle" and "verachtenswerter". Sarcasm and mockery were used to respond to opposing viewpoints, such as the reaction to Gabalier with, "Geilofax, kann man da nur sagen."
*   **Interaction Patterns:** Pezibua frequently engaged in debates, often escalating from sarcasm to direct criticism. They used their professional experience as an authority.

**V. Contextual and Cultural Considerations:**

*   The left-leaning environment of the *Der Standard* forum likely contributed to their negative reactions toward right-wing figures. The forum’s focus on technical expertise also likely influenced Pezibua’s tendency to dismiss opposing views, showing an “in-group/out-group” dynamic. Their adaptation to forum’s casual language demonstrates the context-dependent nature of emotional expression.

**VI. Interpretation and Conceptualization:**

*   Pezibua’s emotional expressions are constructed via the interplay of core affect, cognitive appraisals, and context. Negative core affect, expressed as sarcasm or frustration, was amplified when perceiving injustice, as seen in the “Magic” tournament example, or incompetence, as seen in the public IT commentary.
*   The online environment likely facilitated disinhibited expressions. Pezibua’s analytical style indicated a strong need for logical consistency and fairness, which impacted their responses to injustice, demonstrating the constructed nature of their emotions.
*   A pattern was observed in the escalation from sarcasm to criticism, reflecting how cognitive appraisals shift, in this case when challenged. Their empathy in situations, such as defending supermarket workers and agreeing with the need for representation in the "Magic" tournament, shows the social, not only logical, influence on emotions.
*   They show a consistent emotional intensity in response to illogical arguments or incompetence. The emotions are constructed through the combination of logic, core affect, and expertise, not through a pre-existing template.

**VII. Limitations:**

*   The analysis relies on text data alone. It cannot definitively determine the individual’s full emotional experience. The online persona is not a complete representation of their emotional range.

**VIII. Summary:**

*   Pezibua's forum behavior is marked by a negative core affect, logical argumentation, and the use of expertise. Their expressions of emotions like frustration and indignation are not innate but constructed through the dynamic interaction of core affect, cognitive appraisals, their Austrian cultural identity, and the social conventions of online forums. This is an ideal illustration of constructed emotions.
