Und wenn sie in einer Stadt mit über 2000 jähriger Geschichte, vor allem in der Innenstadt, aufgraben, graben sie eigentlich NUR im historischen Bauschutt, alte Steine/Ziegel sind da ganz normal.  Immerhin wurden vor 100 Jahren die Steinquader gemeldet und Aufzeichnungen darüber gemacht!  Steine sind für Bauarbeiter zuerst einmal Baumaterial.  Oft ist das ein Glück, zB viele alte römische Grabsteine hängen heute im Museum weil sie als ganzes im Fundament eines Hauses verarbeitet wurden und nicht klein gebrochen als Stein einer Wand.  zB die Westfasade des Stephansdomes besteht zum gr Teil aus Steinen der röm Stadtmauer!\n",

Die altbrauchbaren Steine und Ziegel die dabei gewonnen wurden, wurden übrigens verkauft und deckten einen großen Teil der gewaltigen Kosten. Als einmal ein Kundiger bei einer der Baustellen für die neuen Häuser dort am Kai vorbei kam entdeckte er römische Ziegel mit Prägung \"X. Legion\" die dort herumlagen. Die Bauarbeiter stießen nämlich beim Fundament errichten auf Reste der Stadtmauer, diese waren ihnen im Weg, die Ziegeln wurden abgeklopft und gleich wieder in das neue Fundament eingearbeitet! ....

Die Leute hätten sie ja eigentlich. Die einzige Erklärung die sich mir ergibt: Die Egos der Länderchefs. So lange immer mehrere Personen mitmischen wollen, wird das nichts. Prw kann nicht in Ruhe arbeiten und sie könnte es ja eigentlich. Im nrw kampf 17 hat sie teilweise flammende, starke Reden gehalten.

Der Fortschritt lässt sich nicht aufhalten. Auch wenn das Transphob*innen und Rechtsextrem*innen nicht passen sollte, die Zukunft ist bunt und sieht so aus:  https://twitter.com/capslockhustler/status/1070777716461457408\\n> **Kommentiert am** 1.

Und diese auszunutzen und Cis-Frauen in Wettbewerben zu schlagen nur um zu schreien ist äußerst kontraproduktiv für die Anerkennung von Trans-menschen in der Gesellschaft. Das aktuelle Urteil ist daher auch für diese Sportlerinnen positiv: haben Sie - durch OP oder Medikamente - Ihre Serumswerte angeglichen, so dürfen sie starten - und auch für die anderen Menschen ist das dann ein Zeichen \"ok, sie hat keinen unfairen Vorteil - sie traininert einfach hart\".

Specific examples will be drawn directly from the user's comments, paying particular attention to the vocabulary choice, punctuation (e.g., use of exclamation points) and overall tone.\"}, 'cultural_and_social_context': {'rationale': \"The assessment of cultural and social factors is based on identifying references to Austrian society, politics, and culture within the user's comments. The anonymous nature of the forum is likely a contributing factor to the expression of potentially controversial opinions.  The user's engagement with different topics shows awareness of major social and political events in Austria.\", 'discussion': \"The user's comments reflect a cultural context informed by Austrian societal values and the ongoing public debate surrounding issues like gender equality and political corruption.  The user's strong opinions on the Semenya case, reflecting views common in certain social groups, are expressed more freely in the anonymous setting of the online forum.   The comments on the Ibiza scandal display engagement with major political events in Austria, indicating awareness of the national context.  The user appears to use both formal and informal language, suggesting adaptation to the context of different discussion threads.\", 'thought_process': \"This analysis considers how broader societal values and cultural norms of Austria, as well as online communication norms, might shape the user's expression of emotions and engagement in the discussions. The user's comments regarding political news and social events will be especially important to consider. Any potential influence from nationalistic sentiments, or political ideologies will be investigated, as well as how the anonymity of the online forum might be affecting the user's behavior.\"}, 'emotion_construction_analysis': {'analysis': \"The user's emotions are constructed through a complex interplay of core affect, cognitive appraisals, and contextual factors.  In the Semenya case, the negative valence and high arousal stem from a combination of the user's strongly held belief in a biological essentialist view of gender and the perceived injustice to cisgender women athletes.   This view shapes their interpretation of the events, reinforcing their negative emotions. The anonymity of the online forum allows for a more direct and intense expression of these negative emotions.  In other contexts, where these strong pre-conceptions are not engaged, the user expresses a wider range of emotions, demonstrating the flexible nature of emotion construction.\", 'rationale': \"The holistic analysis builds upon the individual analyses of core affect, cognitive appraisal, and context to provide a complete picture of emotion construction.  The user's responses consistently link their emotional reactions to specific interpretations of the events, highlighting the interplay between cognition, affect, and context in shaping their emotional experiences.\", 'thought_process': \"I will synthesize the analysis of core affect, cognitive appraisals, and social context to construct a comprehensive picture of the user's emotional experiences.   I will explain how specific aspects of their cognitive interpretation, core affect, and the context in which the comments were made interact to create their unique emotional responses. This section will offer a complete, holistic narrative of how these elements combine in constructing the observed emotions.\"}, 'emotional_dynamics_and_changes': {'analysis': \"The user's emotional responses exhibit some level of dynamic change.  While there's a strong negative valence and high arousal in the Semenya discussion, the intensity seems to reduce slightly across the thread as the debate progresses.  In contrast, the other topics show less intensity.   There is no clear escalation or de-escalation across the different article threads. This suggests the user's emotional responses are largely context-dependent.\", 'rationale': \"The assessment of dynamic changes in emotion is based on the observation of variations in the user's expressed valence and arousal across different topics and over time within a given thread. While the user's emotional responses are largely topic-specific, there are observable changes in intensity and expression throughout the comment threads. This suggests context and topic influence the intensity of the user's emotions, and these emotional responses appear largely context-dependent.\", 'thought_process': \"By examining the sequence of comments, I'll identify any discernible patterns in the user's emotional state across different discussion threads. I'll analyze whether there are any noticeable shifts in intensity, valence, or arousal of their emotions over the course of their online interactions.  Changes in language use, the length of comments, and the tone will all be important aspects of this analysis.\"}, 'cognitive_appraisal_and_conceptualization': {'analysis': \"The user's interpretations seem deeply rooted in a binary view of gender, particularly in the Semenya case. Their concept of fairness is tightly linked to biological sex, as indicated by comments implying only those with specific biological characteristics should participate in women's sports. This interpretation consistently fuels negative emotions and reinforces their negative valence and high arousal regarding this specific topic.  However, in discussions on other issues, different cognitive frameworks are used, suggesting flexibility in their cognitive appraisals depending on the topic. For example, the user's analysis of potential problems stemming from a long-term power outage reveals a more practical and less emotionally charged interpretation.\", 'rationale': 'This analysis is based on identifying recurring patterns in the user\\'s understanding and framing of the various topics. The user\\'s comments about Semenya reveal a belief in biological essentialism and a strict interpretation of \"fairness\" based on that belief.  Other comments show different modes of interpretation, suggesting that the user doesn\\'t consistently apply the same conceptual frameworks to all situations.', 'thought_process': 'To understand the user\\'s cognitive appraisals and conceptualizations, I will analyze how they interpret the events and issues discussed. I will look for recurring themes and beliefs reflected in their responses, and how those shape their emotional expressions.  Specific focus will be placed on how the user frames and defines concepts like \"fairness,\" \"womanhood,\" and \"justice\" within the various contexts of the conversation threads.'}}\n"
