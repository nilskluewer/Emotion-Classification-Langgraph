      "The user's emotional expressions online are dynamically constructed, reflecting interplay between core affect, cognitive appraisals, and sociocultural context.  Initial responses to the Semenya case exhibited high negative valence and arousal, stemming from appraisals of injustice and perceived threats to fairness in women's sports.  These reactions were tempered by later attempts at rule-based solutions, suggesting a shift towards more controlled emotional regulation.  However, high arousal persisted in interactions involving significant disagreement or controversial topics.  Comments on disaster preparedness showed a different emotional profile, characterized by increasing anxiety and a focus on practical concerns.  Overall, the user demonstrates emotional reactivity, influenced by the online forum’s dynamics and their existing beliefs, reflecting a complex and context-dependent emotional construction process.  A binary understanding of gender appears prevalent in their initial framing of the Semenya case, though not entirely exclusive.  Their communication style demonstrates an engagement with Austrian political and social issues, influencing the expression and shaping of their emotions.\n",

      "The user's emotional expressions on Der Standard demonstrate a dynamic interplay of fluctuating valence and arousal.  Negative valence arises from cynical appraisals of Austrian politics, particularly concerning the FPÖ and ÖVP, and perceived media bias, resulting in frustration, anger, and disgust.  Positive valence emerges from irony, amusement, and satisfaction derived from events aligning with personal expectations, particularly regarding sports.  High arousal is frequent during discussions on emotionally charged topics; however, the user often displays emotional regulation through sarcasm and detached observation.  The user's emotional experience is deeply rooted in their understanding of the Austrian socio-political context and reflects the ongoing national debate, demonstrating a constructed emotional profile influenced by cognitive appraisals, cultural norms, and social dynamics within the online community.\n",
