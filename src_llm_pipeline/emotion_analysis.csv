The story about the woman collapsing on the U6 likely elicited higher arousal due to the life-or-death situation.  Comments like ""mega!! so beginnt der Tag einfach wirklich gut!!"" clearly indicate positive valence and excitement, suggesting elevated arousal.  However, other comments such as ""warum?"" in response to a seemingly nonsensical comment, suggest lower arousal, possibly indicating slight frustration or confusion.";Variable, fluctuating between positive and negative;Moderate to High;"Analyzing Lumachina's comments through the lens of constructed emotions allows for a more nuanced understanding of her responses compared to traditional methods, which might label them as simply ""sad,"" ""angry,"" or ""happy.""  By considering the context, core affect, and conceptualization, we see a complex interplay of factors shaping her expressions. For example, her ""gekränkt"" comment could be misinterpreted as genuine offense. However, considering the context of the political discussion and her other comments, it's more likely a sarcastic remark highlighting the absurdity of political labeling. Similarly, her agreement with the basic income comment reveals underlying values and beliefs about social support, which adds another layer to understanding her online persona and emotional landscape.";It is difficult to classify Lumachina's emotions using traditional categories.  Her responses demonstrate a range of emotions constructed from the interplay of core affect, conceptual knowledge, and context.  Rather than labeling specific emotions, it's more accurate to describe her responses as ranging from empathetic concern and amusement to sarcastic criticism and ironic detachment.;The online forum setting allows for quick reactions and informal language. The political context of many of the articles likely influences Lumachina's emotional responses, particularly given the current events in Austrian politics (the Ibiza affair and subsequent government collapse). The discussions cover serious topics like death and social welfare, but also lighter topics like internet memes, impacting the emotional tone of the comments.;"Lumachina appears to value community and helping behavior, as evidenced by the agreement with the comment about basic income.  She also appears to be sensitive to the suffering of others, shown by her reaction to the U6 story.  In the political comments, she expresses some cynicism and frustration with the current situation, particularly around the actions of certain politicians. Her ""gekränkt"" comment suggests a playful but potentially serious concern about being labeled. There's also a playful, sarcastic tone in some comments, suggesting a tendency to find humor in political events.";"Lumachina uses language like ""ergreifend"" (touching) and ""mega!!"" (great) to express strong feelings. The phrase ""im Hirn eine laufmasche"" (a loose screw in the brain) is a colloquial metaphor that suggests a lack of intelligence or mental stability.  The playful use of ""gekränkt"" (offended) in the ""Laufmasche"" thread uses irony and sarcasm, suggesting an understanding of political labeling and its absurdity.";"Austrian culture and the specific online community norms of this forum likely influence Lumachina's expressions.  The use of certain colloquialisms, such as ""im Hirn eine laufmasche,"" and the sarcastic tone are characteristic of online communication in Austria. The political discussions reflect the highly charged political climate in the country.";"Lumachina's comments regarding the political situation suggest an anticipation of future events, particularly in the comments related to the election results and government changes.  Her ""so beginnt der Tag gut"" comment about the memes related to Kurz's resignation suggests a positive outlook on the future, predicting a change for the better.";"Lumachina's emotions appear to shift depending on the topic and interaction.  She expresses empathy in the U6 story, sarcasm and irony in the ""Laufmasche"" thread, and agreement and positivity regarding basic income and the memes about the government collapse. This suggests that her emotional responses are context-dependent and dynamically constructed.";1

Their language is assertive and opinionated, but not excessively agitated or emotionally charged.  In the immigration discussion, they present a reasoned argument, while the mountain rescue comment shows a higher arousal with charged language like 'Vollidioten.' The astronomy comment and political comments maintain a moderate arousal level, suggestive of engagement and interest, but not high excitement or distress.;Slightly negative to neutral;Moderate;Analyzing the user's comments through the lens of constructed emotions reveals a nuanced picture. Their language, reasoning, and engagement with different topics point to a complex interplay of cognitive appraisal, conceptualization, and contextual factors. While their core affect might be characterized as moderately aroused and slightly negative to neutral, it's crucial to avoid simplistic emotion labels. Instead, we see a dynamic process of constructing emotional experiences based on cultural influences, predictions, and simulations, and ongoing contextual factors.;It is important to avoid simplistic emotion labels and acknowledge the constructive nature of emotions. While elements of frustration, disapproval, and reasoned analysis are evident, assigning a single label like 'anger' or 'disgust' would be reductive. Instead, we see a complex interplay of cognitive appraisals, conceptualizations, and contextual factors shaping the user's emotional responses.;The user's comments are embedded within online discussions on diverse topics, each with its own set of norms and expectations. The immigration topic is highly sensitive and prone to emotional reactions, yet the user maintains a relatively neutral tone.  The mountain rescue discussion invites moral judgments, while the political threads encourage strategic analysis and interpretation of political maneuvering.;The user appraises the situations in the comments through a lens of logic and reason, attempting to explain the motivations and behaviors of others. In the immigration discussion, they interpret the 'fear' as stemming from cultural differences, not xenophobia.  In the mountain rescue comment, they judge the hikers' actions as foolish and entitled. In the political comments, they offer strategic explanations for the actions of political parties.;The user utilizes concepts like 'culture,' 'religion,' and 'values' to explain perceived differences and anxieties related to immigration.  They frame the mountain rescue situation in terms of fairness and responsibility.  In political discussions, they employ political strategy and game theory concepts like 'strong FPÖ' and 'ÖVP advantage' to interpret events.;The user appears to draw on prevailing cultural narratives and anxieties related to immigration in Austria and Germany, referencing cultural and religious differences as potential sources of conflict.  Their comments also reflect a cultural emphasis on responsibility and fairness, particularly evident in the mountain rescue discussion.;The user's comments about the political strategies of different parties suggest an attempt to predict future outcomes and understand the motivations behind current actions.  They also imply an expectation of certain behaviors based on perceived cultural norms (e.g., expecting gratitude towards mountain rescuers).;The user's emotional expressions remain relatively stable across the comments, though the mountain rescue comment shows a brief spike in negativity and arousal. In general, they maintain a moderately engaged and analytical stance.;1

However, comments like ""unreflektiertes wunschdenken, verursacht durch intellektuelle minderleistung"" and ""mir völlig unverständlich, wie man solch nichtssagendes gewäsch absondern kann"" indicate heightened arousal, marked by strong, judgmental language.  His frequent engagement in discussions, even responding to minor challenges, also points to a degree of activation.";Negative to Neutral;Moderate;"Analyzing the user hockshank reveals a pattern of negativity and critical judgment. Context is essential; online discourse is often characterized by disinhibition and amplified emotional expression.  Considering hockshank's comments on diverse topics (politics, music, television), a unifying factor is his consistently negative appraisal.  He seems to find fault or absurdity in various situations, expressing contempt through terms like ""idioten"" and ""fremdschämporno."" His arousal fluctuates, higher when challenged or disagreeing (e.g., responding sarcastically).  Culturally, the German language's directness could be a factor.  Overall, hockshank appears to construct emotional experiences marked by disdain and cynicism, likely rooted in perceived intellectual superiority and negative appraisals of the world.";"Disdain, Contempt, Irritation, Cynicism.  It is important to remember these are constructed categories, and Hockshank's emotional experience is likely a complex blend of these and other related states. Traditional methods might categorize his comments simply as ""anger"" or ""negative,"" missing the nuanced layers of contempt, cynicism, and intellectual superiority.";The context is online discussions on news articles ranging from politics and music to TV shows. This environment encourages strong opinions and debates, which likely contributes to Hockshank's expressive language.  The specific topics, particularly those related to politics, tend to be polarizing and might amplify negative emotional responses.;Hockshank appears to appraise many of the discussed situations negatively. He sees others as intellectually inferior, their actions as foolish or nonsensical, and the topics themselves as often unworthy of attention.  His replies to others' comments indicate an appraisal of being challenged, sometimes responding defensively. He seems to appraise his own perspective as superior or insightful.;"Hockshank uses concepts like ""idioten,"" ""fremdschämporno,"" ""unreflektiertes wunschdenken,"" and ""intellektuelle minderleistung"" to frame his views.  This language suggests a conceptualization of himself as discerning and intelligent, while others are seen as lacking in these qualities.  He appears to conceptualize many of the discussed events as absurd or pointless, reflecting a cynical perspective.";The comments are in German, reflecting a particular cultural context. The use of sharp, direct language may be more acceptable within this context compared to others. Also, the political climate and discussions happening within Austria at the time could influence the specific emotional expressions.;"Hockshank seems to anticipate disagreement with his views, leading to preemptive defensiveness in some responses. For example, ""der unterschied zwischen einem ""beträchtlichem teil"" und ""alle(s)"" ist ihnen klar?"" implies an expectation of being misunderstood or misrepresented. This suggests underlying anxieties or negative expectations regarding social interactions.";"His initial comments often express negative valence.  However, in responses to others, the negativity can escalate, particularly when challenged.  For example, his reply ""ganz ausgezeichnet argumentiert, glückwunsch"" is sarcastic, shifting from a simple statement to a more charged response.";1

The language used, such as ""moralische Hochverrates"" (moral high treason), ""extrem wichtig"" (extremely important), ""schnellstmöglich"" (as quickly as possible), and ""enormen Belastung"" (enormous burden), indicates a heightened state of arousal.  The urgent and emphatic tone further suggests strong activation.";Negative;High;Considering the context, cognitive appraisals, conceptualizations, cultural influences, predictions, and emotional dynamics, ausgewogen09's emotional state appears to be primarily driven by a strong moral condemnation of the political situation and a deep concern for the future of Austria.  The language used, particularly the strong moral terminology and historical references, supports this interpretation.  The user's consistent focus on the perceived threat to democratic values further reinforces this analysis.;ausgewogen09 expresses a complex blend of anger, concern, and contempt. The anger is directed towards Strache and Kurz, the concern focuses on the state of Austrian democracy, and the contempt is evident in the dismissive language used to describe Strache's actions. While these labels are helpful approximations, they don't fully capture the nuanced, constructed nature of the user's emotional experience.;The comments are made in the context of the Ibiza affair and its aftermath, a highly charged political scandal in Austria. This context heavily influences the user's emotional expressions.  The discussions about the future of the Austrian government and the country's international reputation add further layers to the context.;ausgewogen09 interprets Strache's actions as a threat to Austrian democracy and values. They see Kurz's association with Strache as enabling this threat, leading to a negative appraisal of both politicians.  They view the situation as highly consequential for Austria's international reputation and express concern about the future of the country's political landscape.;"ausgewogen09 uses strong moral language (""Hochverrat,"" ""Skrupellosigkeit"") to frame Strache's actions, drawing on concepts of betrayal and lack of integrity.  The metaphor of a ""Wackelkandidat"" (wobbly candidate) portrays Austria's diminished international standing.  They emphasize democratic values and the importance of upholding them, conceptualizing the situation as a critical juncture for Austrian democracy.";The user's emotional expressions are influenced by Austrian political culture and the societal values placed on stability, reputation, and democratic principles.  The historical references to 1933 and Dollfuß reflect a cultural awareness of Austria's past and a concern about repeating historical mistakes.;The user expresses concern about the future consequences of the political situation, predicting further damage to Austria's reputation if Kurz remains in power.  The references to 1933 suggest a fear of potential authoritarian tendencies.  These predictions and simulations contribute to the user's negative emotional state.;While consistently negative in valence, the user's arousal seems to fluctuate. The initial comments express urgent concern, while the later comments reflecting on historical events show a slightly more reflective, albeit still highly charged, emotional state.;1

His use of words like ""herrlich"" and ""Zucker"" conveys genuine enjoyment, while ""bitter"" and ""schiache"" reflects his disappointment.  His critical comments about Barcelona's tactics and Ajax's goalkeeper suggest frustration, and his praise for Liverpool and Tottenham acknowledges their deserved victories.  His repeated references to Ajax and his hope for their success indicate a strong identification with the team, intensifying his emotional investment in their matches.";"Juanchito exhibits a blend of enjoyment, disappointment, admiration, and frustration, all within the context of football fandom. Labeling these as discrete emotions like ""joy"" or ""sadness"" would oversimplify the nuanced, constructed nature of his experience.";The context of online football forums influences Juanchito's expressions. These platforms encourage real-time reactions and discussions with other fans, fostering a sense of shared experience and emotional contagion.  The fast-paced nature of the discussions may amplify emotional responses.;Juanchito interprets the football matches through a lens of fairness and sportsmanship.  He believes Liverpool deserved their win and Tottenham's advancement, acknowledging their strong performances.  However, he also expresses disappointment at Ajax's losses, particularly their near-miss in the semi-final.  He appears to value skillful, offensive play and criticizes Barcelona for what he perceives as negative tactics in the semi-final first leg.;"Juanchito uses football-specific language (""konterspiel,"" ""Zuckerpassspiel"") and metaphors (""Barcatoeter,"" ""ZERreisst"") to express his views. He frames the Champions League season as a narrative with heroes and villains, underdogs and favorites, contributing to the emotional intensity of his experience.";"Juanchito's comments may reflect a Central European football culture that values both skillful play and fighting spirit.  His appreciation for Ajax's ""offensive play"" and his desire for a ""Puyol"" figure at Barcelona suggest a preference for dynamic, passionate football.";Juanchito makes predictions about future matches and outcomes (e.g., hoping Ajax wins, speculating about Liverpool's chances). These predictions, combined with his prior knowledge of the teams and players, shape his emotional responses to unfolding events.;"Juanchito's emotional state fluctuates throughout the comments. He expresses excitement and admiration (""herrlich, danke""), disappointment (""schoen wird wahrscheinlich noch schoen lang schiach dran zum nagen haben""), and frustration (""warum der aussschuss von ajax-tormann 30 sekunden vor schluss"").

While the language doesn't always explicitly convey strong emotion, the context and subtle cues suggest a degree of engagement and reactivity, placing the arousal level in the moderate range.  The quick replies and engagement across various political topics indicate alertness and interest.";"Slightly negative to neutral.  While there are instances of sarcasm and implied criticism, the overall tone is not overtly negative.  The ""No Comment"" could be interpreted as apathy or disengagement, which leans towards neutral valence. The other comments, while critical, don't express strong negative emotions like anger or disgust.  They appear more driven by skepticism or disagreement.  The comments about Kurz, for instance, suggest disapproval but not outright hostility. The comment on the ""Vermummungsverbot"" also hints at a negative valence concerning the topic without explicitly stating it so. The final comment regarding the ÖVP/SPÖ shows slight negativity toward the political parties, but the sarcastic tone keeps it from being intensely negative.  The comment about ""Schnitzel"" again is neutral, stating a matter-of-fact perspective on lifespan which does not provide insights into valence.  The comment about professors’ side-income displays slight positivity suggesting approval for their entrepreneurial spirit.  Calculator's replies are primarily critical of certain actions and statements, particularly regarding certain politicians and regulations.  While not intensely negative, there is a prevailing undertone of cynicism and skepticism in his engagement with others' statements and ongoing political discussion. The comments about the side businesses of professors and people's lifespans lean more toward neutral valence; the core affect's valence and arousal level vary across the comments indicating emotional fluctuation across different discussions, as explained further in other sections.  All things considered, the valence leans slightly toward negative in several comments and neutral in some others. Therefore the final judgment is between negative to neutral.  The variety and brevity of Calculator's comments make the core affect assessment more complicated than just assigning negative/positive or high/low valence since neutrality and mixed emotions are part of the equation when assessing Calculator's comments and core affect dimensions. However, the ""No comment"" answer might hint more at neutrality since there is no subjective input. All other comments have slight negativity due to the critical, sarcastic or rhetorical remarks. The comment about Kurz indicates an attitude of disbelief and opposition without clear negativity or anger.  The question about Maschek indicates slightly negative valence and moderate arousal because of Calculator's perceived absurdity of the described situation. These factors together suggest a slightly negative to neutral valence overall, acknowledging nuances across the individual instances of communication and taking the ""No comment"" remarks into account.  Calculator's focus on logic and reasoning, as evident in the comments on ""Vermummungsverbot"" and professor's earnings, also suggests more moderate arousal levels rather than extremely heightened emotional states.";Moderate;Calculator's comments demonstrate a pattern of critical thinking and skepticism.  The language used reflects a degree of cognitive appraisal, assessing the validity and implications of political statements and actions.  The sarcasm and rhetorical questions suggest an attempt to engage other users and challenge their perspectives.  The context of the discussions and Calculator's apparent familiarity with Austrian politics suggest a deeper level of engagement than simply expressing isolated emotional reactions. By analyzing the user's conceptual knowledge and how it interacts with the other factors, we can construct a detailed understanding of the emotional aspects present in their expressions. It is difficult to determine precise emotional labels to describe user Calculator since the expressions appear matter-of-fact, logical and reasoned. This does not fully align with established labels for specific emotion categories.  However, the subtle cues and undertones of criticism and skepticism allow for the construction of some degree of nuanced emotional understanding. It is important to emphasize the theoretical perspective that emotions are constructed rather than simply read or observed. Therefore labeling is less appropriate in this context.;"Calculator's comments primarily express skepticism, disapproval, and mild cynicism.  There are hints of sarcasm and irony, particularly in the comments directed at political figures or policies.  The ""No Comment"" could be interpreted as apathy or a deliberate avoidance of engagement.  While there are instances of negativity, it's important to avoid labeling these expressions as simply ""anger"" or ""frustration.""  The constructed nature of emotions suggests a more nuanced interpretation, acknowledging the blend of cognitive appraisals, cultural influences, and contextual factors at play. It is important to refrain from simplifying and misrepresenting the user's emotional expressions.";The comments are made within the context of online discussions on a news platform.  The topics are political and societal issues in Austria, including EU politics, government policies, and public figures. This context shapes the emotional expressions, making them more likely to be related to political opinions and social commentary than personal feelings.  The interactive nature of the platform allows for direct responses to other users, as seen in the exchanges regarding Kurz, influencing the emotional dynamics of the conversation.;"Calculator appears to interpret the actions of certain political figures as questionable and worthy of criticism.  The comments regarding Kurz and the EU regulations suggest a judgment of hypocrisy and incompetence.  The ""No Comment"" on the ""Vermummungsverbot"" could be interpreted as a refusal to engage with a topic perceived as absurd or a subtle expression of disapproval. Calculator's comment in response to others discussing ""Schnitzel"" demonstrates a somewhat cynical outlook on public discourse around health. The comment about side businesses for professors and how universities benefit from them indicates that Calculator appreciates entrepreneurial professors’ efforts and views side jobs positively as long as they benefit the educational institutes.";"Calculator uses sarcasm (""Bin ich hier bei Maschek?"") and rhetorical questions (""und dann zuhause auf das dumme Europa schimpfen?"") to express skepticism and disapproval. The use of ""rechte Experimente"" in relation to Kurz suggests a conceptualization of his politics as potentially dangerous or extreme.  Calculator's conceptual knowledge of Austrian politics and public figures (e.g., Maschek) informs the interpretation and expression of their emotions. The comment about life expectancy utilizes factual knowledge and logical reasoning concerning ""Schnitzel,"" which shapes the emotional aspect associated with Calculator's response to Glumanda's initial comment. Similarly, the comment about professors earning money using university property indicates reliance on reasoning and prior knowledge concerning intellectual property and cost.";"Austrian political and social culture likely influences Calculator's emotional expressions.  The references to Maschek and the discussions around Kurz are specific to the Austrian context. Cultural norms regarding expressing political opinions and engaging in online debates also play a role. Austrians tend to be critical of their politicians and public officials, and it is not considered rude to disagree publically.  A neutral or negativistic cultural attitude might influence a matter-of-fact approach such as the statement regarding ""Schnitzel"" and ""Oma's"" health. Cultural norms regarding education might influence the positive attitude toward side-income for professors if the university benefits from the activity.";"Calculator's comments about Kurz and the EU regulations suggest an anticipation of negative consequences or further political maneuvering. The skepticism expressed could be based on past experiences with similar political situations or predictions about future outcomes.  The comment on ""Vermummungsverbot"" might reflect an expectation of further restrictions on personal freedoms or an increase in government surveillance. It is important to acknowledge that there are limitations in speculating about the user's prediction without more information.";"Calculator's emotional expressions vary across different comments. The ""No Comment"" suggests a more neutral or disengaged state, while the comments about Kurz and the EU regulations indicate a more activated and slightly negative state. The replies to other users demonstrate reactivity and engagement, suggesting shifts in emotional intensity based on the interaction.  The comment regarding ""Schnitzel"" demonstrates a different dynamic, possibly influenced by a slightly negative perception of the ongoing discussion concerning ""healthy"" eating habits.  There is no indication of high arousal as the comment is phrased neutrally.  The comment about professors’ extra earnings also indicates a positive emotionality based on Calculator's approval of their activities. The comment and response regarding Kurz and the ""Parteizentrale"" displays slightly higher arousal and more negativity due to political opinions and disagreements.  The other comments vary between negative and neutral, but not high arousal since they appear aloof and distant without engaging personally or strongly emotionally. The sarcastic tone does indicate negative affect, but it is not particularly strong.  In general, there is no significant change in Calculator's attitude between the different comments.  The overall behavior demonstrates a fairly consistent pattern of comments.";1

It is important to note that traditional classification systems might simply label these as ""anger"" or ""disgust,"" failing to capture the nuanced blend of emotions present.";The context of the Ibiza affair and its political fallout heavily influences Akihykiab's emotional expressions. The comments are made within online discussions of articles related to the scandal, indicating that the user is engaged with the political situation and its implications.;"Akihykiab interprets Böhmermann's actions as motivated by ""fanatical hate"" and a desire to harm Austria.  This interpretation fuels negative emotions like disapproval and distrust.  Similarly, the user perceives Kurz as narcissistic and self-serving, leading to feelings of frustration and skepticism towards his leadership.";"The user employs strong, negatively charged language (""hinterfotzig,"" ""klägliche Karriere"") to conceptualize Böhmermann's actions, framing them as deceitful and self-promotional. The description of Kurz as having a ""narcissistic ego trip"" reveals a conceptualization of his behavior as arrogant and inauthentic.";The comments reflect a cultural context where strong political opinions are expressed openly, and criticism of public figures is common.  The user's language and style of argumentation align with online discourse norms, where directness and strong assertions are prevalent.;"The user's comment about Böhmermann being ""schlau genug, dass man ihm keine direkte Erpressung nachweisen kann"" suggests an anticipation of future legal or political consequences.  This prediction adds to the distrust and suspicion directed at Böhmermann.";Akihykiab's negative valence remains consistent across different comments and articles.  While the specific target of criticism shifts (Böhmermann, Kurz), the underlying disapproval and distrust appear to persist throughout the online discourse.;1
