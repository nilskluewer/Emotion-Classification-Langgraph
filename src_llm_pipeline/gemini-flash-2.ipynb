In the Semenya article, Pezibua shows a deep comprehension of biological nuances and their implications for sports competition, rejecting strawman arguments and suggesting category-based solutions. In the medical article, their cognitive appraisal is very negative about the anti-vaccination movement, describing such people as 'kriminell', 'intelligenzallergischen Helikoptermütter' and so forth, showing strong judgment and conceptual links to a broader pattern of harmful behavior. When discussing women in racing, Pezibua highlights many factors around the complexities of gender, showing a nuanced understanding of the topic, but using a negative comparison with a 'Puff zur Förderung der weiblichen Sexualität'. In the article about the SPÖ, Pezibua appraises the event as overblown, stating: 'zwischen \\\"ungestüm formuliert\\\" und \\\"dreckigster Sexismus\\\" sind aber noch gefühlt 1000 Grauschattierungen'. Pezibua also shows a strong grasp of software development details, with examples regarding Windows containers and Adobe product licensing, correcting other users when needed. Pezibua also shows good insight into the public service and it's problems. Finally, Pezibua demonstrates good understanding of academic research standards, criticizing the university and its rector for approving a racist thesis.

Their response to the software licenses ('Das Gesudere wg. der Preise ist eh komplett jenseitig') shows a strong negative valence too.

While they rarely display extreme emotional reactions, they show an active and engaged response style, often with a hint of annoyance or frustration. The use of terms like 'Dünnpfiff' and 'peinliche Farce', while not aggressive, does show a certain level of agitation. In their response to MamaPolasz, their tone escalates from sarcastic to slightly hostile in the last message, displaying a high level of arousal ('Bitte Ruhe, wenn die Erwachsenen reden.').

The conceptual knowledge, seen in their tech-related comments and awareness of social issues, frames these appraisals, providing a basis for their critical analyses. The online context of the forum allows for more confrontational and direct forms of engagement. They display a conceptual understanding of the technical fields, which enables them to feel frustrated when the debate in a discussion doesn't align with their knowledge base.
