<h1>Synthesized Emotional Profile Report</h1>
<p><strong>I. Identifying Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Username:</strong> Anonymized UserX</li>
<li><strong>Source of Data:</strong>  Online forum comments from "Der Standard" collected between 01.05.2019 and 31.05.2019.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Reason for Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This analysis aims to demonstrate the application of the theory of constructed emotions to online text data, illustrating how emotional expressions are constructed rather than simply read out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Data Sources and Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data consists of UserX's comments on various articles within the specified timeframe.</li>
<li>The analysis employs a qualitative approach, focusing on the interplay of core affect (valence and arousal), cognitive appraisals, conceptual knowledge, language use, and socio-cultural context, as outlined in the theory of constructed emotions.</li>
<li>This analysis is based solely on textual data and cannot definitively determine UserX's subjective emotional experiences.  It offers an interpretation based on observable behavior within a specific online context.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Behavioral Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Affect:</strong> Predominantly negative valence and high arousal, particularly in political discussions.  This is evident in frequent expressions of anger, disgust, and contempt.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Language:</strong>  Strong, emotionally charged language is prevalent, including terms like "erbärmlich," "Dreck," "Abschaum," and "trottel," directed primarily at political figures and parties.  Sarcasm is also observed, as in the response "Oh danke!" to being called "Geschmacklos!"</li>
<li><strong>Interaction Patterns:</strong>  UserX engages actively in discussions, often responding directly to other users.  Interactions range from dismissive to more engaged debates, reflecting dynamic social interactions within the forum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Contextual and Cultural Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The data comes from "Der Standard," an Austrian newspaper, during May 2019, a politically charged period following the Ibiza affair.  This context likely influences UserX's emotional expression, as the forum provides a platform for discussing and reacting to these events.  The online environment may also contribute to disinhibition and amplified emotional responses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VI. Interpretation and Conceptualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UserX's emotional expressions align with the theory of constructed emotions.  For example, the comment "Strache = trottel und schande der Nation" demonstrates the interplay of negative core affect (anger, contempt), a negative cognitive appraisal (judging Strache as incompetent and immoral), and the socio-political context (the Ibiza affair).  This illustrates how emotions are constructed through a combination of internal states and external influences.  The sarcastic "Oh danke!" suggests a more nuanced emotional response, possibly masking frustration or anger with a socially acceptable expression within the forum's norms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VII. Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This analysis is based solely on text and cannot definitively determine UserX's true emotional state.  It provides an interpretation based on observable online behavior, which may not fully reflect UserX's offline emotional experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VIII. Report Findings:</strong></p>
<p>UserX exhibits a pattern of constructing negative emotions, primarily anger and contempt, in response to political events, particularly those involving the FPÖ.  This pattern is evident in the consistent use of strong negative language, high arousal, and critical appraisals of political figures.  The online forum environment likely amplifies these expressions.  While predominantly negative, UserX's emotional responses are not static.  Variations in arousal and the use of sarcasm suggest dynamic emotional regulation and responses to social interactions within the forum.  The context of the Ibiza affair and the broader Austrian political climate in May 2019 significantly shape UserX's emotional landscape.  The analysis demonstrates how emotions are constructed through the interplay of core affect, cognitive appraisals, and socio-cultural context, rather than being simply expressed.  The limitations of text-based analysis necessitate caution in interpreting these findings as definitive representations of UserX's subjective emotional experience.  Further research incorporating physiological and contextual data could provide a more comprehensive understanding.</p>
