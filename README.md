# Context over Categories: Implementing the Theory of Constructed Emotion with LLM-Guided User Analysis

This is the working repo for [LLM-as-LisaFeldmanBarrett
](https://github.com/nilskluewer?tab=repositories) which was a stable state of the Implementation for my Master Thesis at TU Wien in 2024/25.

There is a Publication: [Context over Categories: Implementing the Theory of Constructed Emotion with LLM-Guided User Analysis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706599.3721205)
There is the Thesis: [Context over categories : implementing the theory of constructed emotion](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/215623)

This Repo was used to work on this topic and contains the full process and ideation process. The implemntation is rather simple and definently not clean code python conform. But due to the fast iteration cycles of GenAI and the Tools connected to it there was no need in making production ready software.
