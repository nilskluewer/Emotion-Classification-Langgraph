While discrete categories fail to encompass such constructed states, this range helps map Hockshank's affect given his sociocultural influence.;The political climate surrounding the news articles (Kurz, Strache, FPÖ) likely plays a role in the expression of negativity and cynicism. The entertainment articles provide a different context where Hockshank's disdain seems directed at perceived lowbrow entertainment and its audience.

";The user's emotional experience can be best characterized as a blend of indignation, contempt (towards Strache and Kurz), and anxiety (regarding the future of Austrian politics and its international standing). While these labels capture the dominant affective quality, it's crucial to acknowledge the constructed nature of these emotions and their dependence on the user's appraisal of the situation.;"The comments are made within the context of the ""Ibiza affair"" and its political fallout in Austria.

They perceive Strache's views and actions as an attack on Austria, describing them as ""moralischen Hochverrat.""

Their interpretation focuses on the perceived damage to Austria's international reputation and the undermining of democratic principles.";"The user conceptualizes the political events through the lens of morality and betrayal.  The repeated use of ""moralischen Hochverrat"" frames the situation as a violation of ethical principles and a profound breach of trust.  They also employ a metaphor of ""Schlüssel der Staatsgewalt in die Hand drückte"" (handing over the keys of state power) to depict Kurz's actions as enabling the perceived threat.";The user's concerns about Austria's international reputation and adherence to democratic values reflect a cultural emphasis on political stability and integrity within the European context.  The reference to the historical figure of Dollfuß and the controversy surrounding his painting within the ÖVP further highlight the cultural and historical sensitivities embedded within the current political landscape.;The user's comments imply a pessimistic outlook on the future of Austrian politics if Kurz remains in power. They foresee further damage to Austria's reputation and the continued erosion of democratic values.  The reference to historical events serves as a warning against repeating past mistakes.;The user's emotional state remains consistently negative and highly aroused across the comments, suggesting a sustained concern and indignation regarding the political situation.  There are subtle shifts in focus—from Strache's actions to Kurz's responsibility and then to historical parallels—but the intensity of their negative affect persists.;2

While he expresses strong opinions and preferences about the football matches, his language remains conversational and doesn't indicate heightened excitement or anxiety. The use of terms like ""herrlich,"" ""schoene wird wahrscheinlich noch schoen lang schiach dran zum nagen haben,"" and ""top spiel!!"" suggests engagement and interest, but not extreme elation or distress.";Overall Slightly Positive, with fluctuations;Moderate;Considering the comments in their entirety and informed by the constructed emotion theory by Barret, Juanchito's posts reveal a nuanced and dynamic emotional landscape shaped by context.  His emotions are rooted in the performance, outcomes, and surrounding discussions of the football matches he follows, constructed via interplay of conceptual acts, individual experience and culture specific constructs in football contexts, and current affect based on appraisals about control, certainty, etc.;"Juanchito exhibits a range of nuanced emotions: Hope, Disappointment, Satisfaction, and perhaps even a touch of Schadenfreude. Rather than pinpointing primary emotions and assuming inherent biological fingerprints for each (traditional view), Barret's approach lets us identify several emotional categories dynamically shaped by past experiences of being a sports fan and cognitive appraisals rooted in game context. He expresses enjoyment (""herrlich, danke""), anticipation (""hoffentlich schaffts Ajax""), regret (""schoen wird wahrscheinlich noch schoen lang schiach dran zum nagen haben""), and admiration (""top spiel"").";The context is online discussions about Champions League football matches. This context plays a significant role in shaping Juanchito's expressed emotions, which are largely focused on the excitement, disappointments, and analyses related to the games. This very specific conversational context (football fans, short written comments) influences what affective behaviors are shared and visible.;Juanchito seems to be appraising the situations primarily through the lens of a sports enthusiast.  His focus is on the performance of the teams, the fairness of the outcomes, and the excitement of the matches.  There's a cognitive appraisal of 'desirability' (wanting Ajax to win) combined with appraisals of 'certainty' (predicting outcomes) and 'controllability' (analyzing team strategies and player choices that influence match outcomes).;"Juanchito uses football-specific language (""konterspiel,"" ""Zuckerpassspiel,"" ""ausgeputzt"") to conceptualize and describe his emotional experience, aligning with his identity as a football fan. The emotional experience is also structured by conceptual metaphors, like when a particular bad pass situation is framed metaphorically with ""sah ich eine schlimme Nacht fuer die Katalanen.""";The cultural influence of football fandom is apparent in Juanchito's comments.  He uses shared language and expressions common among football fans, engages in playful banter and predictions, and demonstrates a strong identification with the teams he supports.;"Juanchito makes predictions about match outcomes and also references potential future scenarios, indicating the influence of anticipated experiences on his emotions. For example, placing a bet mid-game is likely fueled by his simulation that the match's dynamics and eventual outcome fit that of a very probable ""bad night"" for FC Barcelona.  And when thinking about the overall tournament experience after disappointing moments he writes, “schade, dass es kein Spiel um den dritten Platz” as a scenario to fix or diminish such a let-down moment, driven by simulation based emotional predictions. Such conceptual action reflects core affect properties where the expected change in circumstances should impact current emotional experiences beyond external behavioral expression.";Juanchito's emotional expressions shift throughout his comments. He shows excitement and hope for Ajax, disappointment when they lose, satisfaction at Barcelona's defeat (after initially predicting their victory), and appreciation for the overall quality of the Champions League season.;2

Given the sociopolitical context, it can be inferred they expect absurdity, given the repeated reactions over time, influencing cognitive evaluations and interpretations leading to skepticism as an apparent primary underlying lens of appraisal. However, the intellectual engagement also present implies underlying interest and an expectation of thought-provoking ideas—thus producing not always solely negative emotion.;Calculator predominantly exhibits skepticism, mild disapproval, and occasional amusement.

Their comments frequently challenge or question the statements of others, particularly in political contexts.  They also appear to evaluate information based on its logical coherence and implications.;"Calculator utilizes language that reflects skepticism and intellectual engagement. Sarcasm (""Bin ich hier bei Maschek?"") is used to express disapproval and highlight perceived absurdity.  The succinct ""No comment"" reflects a conscious decision to withhold judgment or avoid engaging in certain discussions.";Calculator's comments indicate an awareness of Austrian political and social context. Referencing Maschek and specific Austrian politicians suggests familiarity with local media and cultural discussions.

Their past experiences, indicated in the general activity displayed and the knowledge of the culture and sociopolitical arena likely influence their conceptualization and anticipation of negative actions taken, shaping expectations and reactions like sarcasm and subtle disapproval when the concepts and reactions reemerge.;"There is some fluctuation in Calculator's displayed emotional responses. While often exhibiting restraint or skepticism, certain comments show amusement or subtle sarcasm. The ""No comment"" response stands in contrast to other comments suggesting emotional engagement with political discussions, creating an element of restrained engagement in the online sphere.

His commentary occurs online, demonstrating a specific choice in public information dissemination that potentially relates to emotional gratification, social affirmation and the need for collective emotional expression related to team performance and success.;Juanchito seems to appraise the football matches primarily through the lens of sportsmanship and enjoyment. He analyzes games strategically, noting team strengths and weaknesses. For instance, his comments about Ajax's offensive play and Liverpool's deserved win show he assesses team performance, considering gameplay elements. He values fair play and exciting matches, focusing on the quality of the game more than just wins and losses. For example, he expresses disappointment about Ajax not reaching the final but recognizes Tottenham's deserved victory. Additionally, he acknowledges the deservingness of Barcelona's win in another context;"Juanchito uses football-specific language and metaphors to express his views. His concept of 'geile Saison' encapsulates his overall positive appraisal of an enjoyable football experience that delivered ""toller fussball"".  He labels Tottenham negatively, however, expressing that their advancement denies the realization of his personally idealized 'perfekte finale', Barcelona against Ajax, highlighting the personal nature of conceptualization even in sports evaluation.   Furthermore, ""ZERreisst"" and ""MITreisst"" suggest emotional impact metaphors to illustrate Puyol's qualities as a teammate. Notably, concepts around sport, gameplay, performance and aesthetics, play significant roles in his narrative";The comments demonstrate a culturally rooted engagement with football. Shared excitement about the Champion's League competition fuels many interactions, as these match results matter significantly within a fan community. It can be assumed there is existing fan allegiance and history connected to the use of the emotionally charged expression, 'schoene wird wahrscheinlich noch schoen lang schiach dran zum nagen haben…', a sentiment easily interpreted, specifically within communities affected by perceived historic 'bad luck', underperformance, or past disappointment related to their favored team, Ajax, specifically. Juanchito connects emotionally to Ajax based on their geographic and/or cultural proximity to his specific regional and or linguistic background, demonstrated linguistically through use of phrases such as 'schoene…schiach'. His familiarity with Austro-Bavarian linguistic and cultural constructs is present across many contexts. Lastly, Juanchito shares the value of combativeness and fighting spirit within football discourse, appreciating figures like Puyol known for these qualities. ;"Juanchito anticipates positive outcomes for his favored teams (Ajax, Barcelona). The early strategic errors of Ajax trigger his emotional reactions ( ""ajax is sicher noch nicht durch...""). Similarly, he sets 'perfekte finale' expectations which influence his later perception when Tottenham prevail. Despite his preemptive ""hoffentlich schaffts Ajax"" comment on an article on the second leg of the semifinal against Tottenham, reflecting high positive expectation. His reaction shifts into disappointed analysis of Ajax and a qualified recognition of Tottenham following the loss, reflecting this prior optimism. Predictions drive expectation influencing his immediate and overall emotional evaluation based on match developments and final outcomes, typical for most team and or individual performance-centered fan or sports engagement.";His emotional expression demonstrates mixed dynamics. Anticipation shifts towards varying emotional tones from approval (e.g. Ajax) to sarcasm about specific performance or the fairness of results (e.g.,Barcelona) after the respective matches unfold. Disappointment shifts toward reluctant recognition, particularly visible after Tottenham overcomes his favoured Ajax and advances. Finally, sustained hope and optimism resurfaces as the next team and favored match approaches.;2

These tend to polarize reactions, leading Calculator to question public discourse and express their critical stances on various political maneuvers. Therefore, given the social climate surrounding those topics and ongoing political discourse of their political context the comments are critical and sarcastic in nature.;Calculator appears to appraise the political situations discussed with skepticism and cynicism. For example, in the comment regarding Kurz's criticism of the EU and previous involvement with it, Calculator challenges the narrative through sarcasm and references a comedic media group ('Maschek'), likely viewing Kurz as performative.;"Calculator seems to conceptualize political discourse as largely performative. Comments tend to point out inconsistencies, critique motivations, and highlight perceived hypocrisy from public figures and the systems in place.  The sarcastic tone reinforces this view.

The repeated use of 'dumm' ('stupid') and phrases like 'Mittlerweile zweifle ich an der Intelligenz unserer Species' ('meanwhile, I doubt the intelligence of our species'), reflect a strong sense of frustration and disappointment. These emotional expressions can be understood as constructions shaped by cultural understanding of education, politics and economic justice.  Their cynicism appears fueled by their beliefs about social interactions in online public domains ('the things are getting tough', 'people only think for themselves'). This aligns with social construction theories suggesting emotions stem from social learning and culturally influenced conceptions of normality. Therefore frustration in online discourse blends perceived deviance with negative future expectations about a specific topics consequences (e.g. Australia ignoring or even working against actions to counteract climate change).;DJinDownUnder's comments express primarily frustration, cynicism, and disappointment.  Frustration stems from their perception of voter ignorance ('people do not inform themselves'). Cynicism is evident in their descriptions of politicians ('selfish here, selfish there'). Disappointment is shown through expressions of hopelessness regarding environmental disregard.

Additionally they mention the specific political party affiliations.;DJinDownUnder makes predictive statements ('young people are the ones that will suffer') reflecting their expectation of future hardships ('the young will swallow the toad but still vote for those who complicate their future'). The combination of negative predictions about environmental topics and frustration over the voter's political decision paint a certain degree of pessimistic predictions.;DJinDownUnder's emotional expression shifts over their comments and the overall narrative unfolds over the articles commented on and multiple individual threads they engage in.

Sarcastic and challenging comments like the ones about the Gabalier ban and the Uno game suggest heightened arousal, possibly excitement or frustration.

The defensive tone in later comments during the Game of Thrones discussion could indicate increasing arousal associated with frustration or agitation.;Mostly Negative with instances of Positive Valence;Moderate to High;Oul'Smonk's language, especially the use of sarcasm and metaphors, suggests an active attempt to make sense of and regulate their emotions through humor and reactive commentary. They contextualize interactions with apparent focus to their perception of those of negativity, often turning seemingly less extreme interactions such as user agreement into those of ironic humor with varying focus, indicating how internal experiences shape emotions more then their social context would be associated within conventional emotion theory.;Sarcastic amusement, mild frustration and disapproval, defensiveness. It is likely that some level of anger/irritation underlies Oul'Smonk's comments on multiple topics within a combination of irony/amusement or disapproval depending on other users. Their initial approach being to provide ironic agreement over disagreement likely serves to indicate their dissatisfaction or to draw other user's dissatisfaction out more dramatically to generate a more intensive level of reaction or sarcasm again after. Later interactions with User: FranzKpunkt indicate clear anger on both sides over differences of opinions in which the other is not only considered being factually wrong but personally in their behaviour based on their emotional expression.  These classifications align with the conceptual act model proposed by Lisa Feldman Barrett.;The context shifts across multiple online discussions, influencing the expressed emotion. The diverse topics, from music bans to sports victories and parenting, provide distinct backgrounds for Oul'Smonk's comments.  The shift from humor and agreement to defensiveness in the Game of Thrones thread showcases how interaction context impacts the user's expressed emotion.;Oul'Smonk's appraisals appear primarily focused on the perceived absurdity or injustice of certain situations. In the Gabalier case and the Uno example, there's a sarcastic appraisal of what they consider to be unreasonable behavior. In the Game of Thrones discussion, their appraisal shifts towards defensiveness against what they see as an attack on emotional expression.;"Oul'Smonk uses sarcasm and humor to conceptualize their emotions. Metaphors, such as comparing a musical performance to ""a plate of cow dung"" or imagining burning an Uno deck, indicate a conceptualization of events as frustrating or ridiculous. Their defense of emotional expression in the Game of Thrones thread frames emotion as acceptable and authentic, contrasting with FranzKpunkt's dismissive conceptualization.";The user engages in discussions relating to popular culture (Game of Thrones, music), news events (Gabalier ban), sports, and commonplace social interactions (Uno). This reflects the user's embeddedness within cultural contexts relevant to online discussions, where social dynamics like agreement, sarcasm, and argumentation influence expressed emotions. Austrian cultural norms may contribute towards their participation.;The sarcastic nature of comments about predictable outcomes and behavior indicates that prior events have reinforced these patterns of predictions about others behaviour for Oul'Smonk. These past experiences of disagreement combined with humour form Oul'Smonk's present attitude and expressions. Oul'Smonk appears skeptical of emotional expressions surrounding events with limited personal investment such as public grieving by actors. Their focus seems geared toward those events and groups within which personal involvement exists such as sports fandom or family situations. Negative comments made toward personal behavior appear less critical towards those of a close relation with no direct interpersonal influence but increase significantly based on the involvement towards user's such as FranzKpunkt during the conversation surrounding 'Game of Thrones', and slightly more subtle hints towards similar affects concerning another user's choice of political alignment during 'Das Verbot'. While some negative affect seem directed to situations directly they become clearly more emphasized towards interpersonal interaction.;Initially, Oul'Smonk's emotional responses appear sarcastic and mildly negative.  There is an underlying tone of displeasure or disagreement within a certain level of amusement or irony towards most topics, shifting over to a clearly defined negative and defensive affect as another user criticizes Oul'Smonk.;2

Meanwhile positive valence combined with conceptualization based on value-laden, national identity create an emotional evaluation akin to pride and patriotism for “doing the right thing” through not judging their leaders strictly, resulting in the expressed acceptance for Kurz.;Akihykiab appears to experience indignation, disapproval, contempt (towards Böhmermann), possibly blended with a sense of concern or anxiety about the political situation. She further expresses begrudging respect/approving defiance (toward Kurz).  These complex emotional states are not reducible to basic emotions but rather emerge from a dynamic interplay of appraisal, contextual factors, and past experiences.

This appraisal frames Böhmermann as a malicious actor intentionally seeking to harm Strache and Austria.  This interpretation fuels Akihykiab's negative emotional response.  Conversely, Akihykiab appraises Kurz's actions as ""tadellos1A"" despite the political crisis. This appraisal is likely influenced by Akihykiab's existing political views, leading to approval where others perceive failure.

Böhmermann also is constructed as antagonist, since he attacked political and cultural norms.;"Akihykiab's comments suggest a prediction that Böhmermann will not face direct consequences due to strategic maneuvering ( ""schlau genug, dass man ihm keine direkte Erpressung nachweisen kann"").  The individual projects potential consequences onto her constructed “Böhmermann-Concept” derived from experiences, which evokes additional negative affect toward that. Furthermore the absence of negative actions by Kurz support this perception through not falsifying it.";Akihykiab expresses consistent negativity toward Böhmermann across multiple comments and articles.
